Given many highly correlated features, use few linear combinations of them.

3.5.1 Principal Components Regression

Use $M \leq p$ principal components. 

1. Since principal components are orthogonal, $\hat{y}$ is sum of univariate regressions.
2. Principal components depend on scale of features.
3. Similar to ridge: instead of shrinking coefficients with smaller singular values, drop them.
