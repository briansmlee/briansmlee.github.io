Key ideas from chapter 2:

# 1
- Random Variable (RV) is a function from $$\Omega$$ to $$\mathbb{R}$$.
- Suppose $$A$$ is subset of $$\mathbb{R}$$. Define probability of RV $$X$$ having values in $$A$$ as:

$$P(X \in A) = P(X^{-1}(A))$$, where $$X^{-1}(A)$$ is a set of outcomes that $$X$$ maps to $$A$$.

# 2
- CDF of a RV $$X$$ is a function $$F(x) = P(X \leq x)$$.
- If $$X$$ is discrete, PMF of a RV $$X$$ is $$f(x) = P(X = x)$$.
- If $$X$$ is continuous, its PDF $$f$$ satisfies $$P(a < X < b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$$ (+ non-negative and integrates to 1).
- Then, $$F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f(t) dt$$ and $$f(x) = F'(x)$$ (continuity caveats).

# 5
- If X and Y are both discrete RVs, their joint PMF is $$P(X = x, Y = y)$$. 
- If both continuous, joint PDF satisfies: $$\forall A, P((X, Y) \in A) = \int \int_{A} f(x, y) dx dy$$.
- TODO: do X and Y always have same domain, $$\Omega$$?
- TODO: what if mix of discrete and continuous RVs?

# 6
- Marginal PMF, PDF, CDF of X

# 7
- Independence of RVs (defined in terms of probability).
- Independce by PDF (Thm 2.30).

# 8
- If we observed $$Y = y$$, what is conditional distribution of $$X$$? Conditional PMF as joint PMF over marginal PMF of Y.
- Conditional PDF has same definition. But, $$P(X \in A \vert Y = y) = \int_{A} f(x \lvert y) dx$$.
