Curse of dimensionality

# Cube example

Suppose a p-dimensional hypercube. The edge length $$e$$ of the hypercube that captures fraction $$r$$ of the volume is $$e = r^{1/p}$$ because $$r / 1 = e^p$$. 

For example, in 10-dimensions, edge length of 0.5 captures only 0.001 of the volume.

# Points are closer to edge
